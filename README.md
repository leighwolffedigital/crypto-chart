# Bitcoin Price Chart

## The Task:

Using a React based framework (Create React App, NextJS, Preact) of your choice, create a simplified version of a crypto tracking chart. It should plot the price of a cryptocurrency coin of your choice in USD over time, with options to change the time frame.

### Key Decisions

- The third party libraries I decided to use were: @testing-library, styled-components and axios
- This is a single page application that renders nested child components
- The useReducer hook was utilized for state management, this allowed for cleaner control of the both the button and the chart when re-rendering upon the update of "time period" selection.
- Axios was used to make the api call, mainly due to it's popularity and familiarity.
- The Chart Container contains 2 main components the Chart Controls and the Chart itself. Separting each into it's own component helps with maintainability in the future.
- A mix of styled-components and classes were used due to time contraints.
- The useEffect hook was used to trigger the api calls, in an effort to optimize performance and prevent the api call for every refresh, the selected control value was passed as a second arguement to skip applying the effect if the value hasn't changed.

### Potential Next Steps

- Write more tests eg. for ChartContainer Component, mocking api call, triggering useEffect on state update
- Add More Styling and transition to button controls
- Add More Data to the Chart

# Create React App General Info

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
